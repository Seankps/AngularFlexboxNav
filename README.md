# Nav: Angular, Flexbox, Material

I've created a simple, basic, Nav to use as a starting point in my Angular projects. It has a typical Material coloring, shadow, and font. Although, it does not use any 3rd party libraries. It's all just basic HTML and SCSS, with a little Angular thrown in to handle the mobile open/close status.

Just add the "Nav" component folder to your project. Import the component, and drop in the nav selector:

    <nav></nav>

and that's it. Please enjoy and feel free to contribute.
